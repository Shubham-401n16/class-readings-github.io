JSX is JAVAScript XML.It allows Java Script and HTML seamlessly mixed together.

What can cause a render (or re-render) of a component?
Render is to build and display the HTML element(s) on our webpage.

When a render happens, how is the DOM affected
DOM stands for “Document Object Model”, and refers to how an HTML page is interpreted and stored, 
so that pieces can be dynamically changed. The DOM of an HTML page will break up the page into a tree structure when rendered.

What is one thing a framework does that a library doesn’t do?

A library is a collection of tools that you can use to speed up complex development processes. 
We can call upon those tools wherever you see fit in your application. 
A framework, on the other hand, sets up rigid places for you to add your code and framework controls
the flow when certain functions are used.
