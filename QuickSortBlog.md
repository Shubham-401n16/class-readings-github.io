Quick Sort 

Need to find  the "pivot" element in the array.
Left pointer at first element of the array.
Right pointer at last element of the array.
Check left pointer is less than the pivot element and 
then move the left pointer to the right by adding 1 to the left index. 
Keep incrementing until left side element is greater than or equal to the pivot element.
Check right pointer is greater than the pivot element 
and keep decrementing it to the left by subtracting 1 to the right index. 
Keep decrementing until right side element is less than or equal to the pivot element.
Check if left pointer is less than or equal to right pointer and check the elements in locations of these pointers.
After this increase the left pointer and decrease the right pointer.
Then check if  index left pointer is still less than the index of the right pointer and 
then repeat the process otherwise return the index of the left pointer.
