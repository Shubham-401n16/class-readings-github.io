What is a role used for?
Each user role (admin, editor, user, guest, etc) defines what CRUD operations (or capabilities) are accessible to that user.

Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
Role Based Access Control is more scalable as it has
two data models (one for users and one for roles) and developers can quickly edit, 
change or increase the number of possible roles without largely affecting user data.
