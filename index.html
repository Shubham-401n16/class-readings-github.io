            Why would you want to run JavaScript code outside of a browser?
            <br>
    
            This lets us do more with java script aside from building simple web sites

            What is the difference between a module and a package?
            <br>
            Modules are pieces of JavaScript code that are meant to be called in another file or chunk of code.
            Packages are an extension of modules, and they are what make the Node.js ecosystem so powerful.
            Packages allow developers to make complex chunks of code that serve a certain purpose,
            and then publish and share those packages for other developers to use.

            What is one benefit of Test Driven Development?
            Better coverage of all business requirements by writing tests first and then writing code to get my tests
            pass.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is one potential downside of Test Driven Development?
            <br>
            As a developer its difficult to understand what all functions and modules will be required to meet one
            business requirement.
            Hence writing tests for what you don't know ends up being difficult and sometimes impossible.

            What does the node package manager do?
            <br>
            npm is the worldâ€™s largest software registry.
            Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages,
            and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.
