AngularJS

AngularJS has a very complex and fixed structure because it's based on the three layers — Model, View, and Controller — 
typical of single-page applications. An object $scope in AngularJS is responsible for the Model part, which is initialized
by the Controller and then transformed into HTML to create the View for the user. AngularJS provides many standard services, 
factories, controllers, directives, and other components that will take some time for a JavaScript developer to master initially.

With AngularJS we break the application code into several files. For example, when we create a reusable \
component with our own directive, controller, and template, we must describe each chunk of code in a separate file. 
Once we describe our directive, we then add a link to our template in the directive to couple these parts. AngularJS 
directives represent the template logic for your application. The template is HTML extended with AngularJS directives, 
generally written as tags or attributes. We also add controllers to provide our models with necessary $scope or context. 
Controllers are written in separate files as well. When we modularize our application in such a way, we can reuse our 
template or component in a different part of the website.

Differences Between Angular Vs React Js
Programming Language — TypesScript v/s JavaScript and JSX Script
Angular uses Typescript (can also use JavaScript if needed) which is a 
superset of JavaScript appropriate for larger projects. It is compact and 
allows for identifying mistakes in typing. TypeScript is also advantageous 
because it has better navigation, faster-code refactoring and auto-completion etc. 
Thus TypeScript being clean, scalable and compact makes it an ideal choice for enterprise-scale large projects.
Meanwhile, React.JS uses JavaScript ES6+ and JSX Script (syntax extension for JavaScript to simplify UI coding to make it look like HTML). 
JSX simplifies coding visually, so your React JS developers for hire can easily detect errors and protect code from injections. '
JSX also utilizes browser compilation through Babel, a compiler that translates code into web-browser readable format. 
The JSX syntax also runs the same functions as the TypeScript-although some programmers find it too complicated.
