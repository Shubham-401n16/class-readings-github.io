What is a leaf node? Why is it important to be able to find leaf nodes?

 A leaf Node is a Node without any subsequent edges / connections.It can be good reference point for traversing.
 
Describe the differences between pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal. Why are they called pre, in, and post order? 
 A Pre-order traversal starts from the root and then goes left and then right node.
An In-order traversal starts from the left and moves to root and then to right node.
A Post-order traversal starts from the left then moves to right and then to the root node.

What is the height of a fully balanced (each non-leaf node has two children) tree? What is this used for?
The height of a fully balanced tree is O(2).This is important as we are noyt allocating any additional space,

How are stacks and queues used in relation to trees?
Depending on traversal methods we can use stacks or queues to implement our programmes.
