Graph is a non-linear data structure. A graph G contains a set of vertices V and set of Edges E. Graph has lots of application in computer science.
Graph is basically divided into two broad categories :

Directed Graph (Di- graph) – Where edges have direction.
Undirected Graph – Where edges do not represent any directed
There are various ways to represent a Graph :-

Adjacency Matrix
Adjacency List
There are several other ways like incidence matrix, etc. but these two are most commonly used.

For traversal breadth first and depth first are used
